\begin{theorem} \label{theTheorem}
  Assume that a point-mass robot with a planar, first-order, fully controlled
  motion model and a 360$^\circ$ scanner operates in a planar environment.
  Let the latest scan measurement from the robot provide a set of
  candidate gaps $\rgpSet$ to travel through based on the {\em Swept Gap
  Prioritization} algorithm followed by gap convexification.  The
  trajectory $\traj$, generated by forward integrating along the vector
  field $\Dv$ constructed from the gap $\gap^* \in \gapSet$ when starting 
  from the robot position $x$ located at the source position of the
  scan, is guaranteed to result in collision-free passage across the gap
  boundary.
\end{theorem}
