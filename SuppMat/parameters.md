# Potential Gap Parameters and Values Used

The implementation has been configured for use by a Turtlebot 2 robot. Many of the parameter values are geometric quantities that should scale with the Turtlebot's radius and its other properties. The parameters are organized according to the different sections within the Potential Gap manuscript.

### Gap Detection

| Parameter |        Value      | Meaning |
| --------- | :---------------: | ------- |
| d<sub>max</sub> | 3 | Maximum value of egocircle (or laser scan) range values. Mostly determined by the sensor. Can be set lower if those values are too uncertain so that even a few closer points can be considered far. |
| r<sub>ins</sub> | 0.18 | Inscribed radius of the robot. Determined by geometry of the robot. Value here is for the Turtlebot.  |
| &tau;<sub>a</sub> | 3&pi;/4 | Threshold on angle between the gap chord and the shortest side (define by the closest gap edge point to robot). Determines what gaps are classified as radial gaps. |
| c<sub>a</sub> | &pi;/2 | Threshold on acceptable angular difference between most distant gap edge points for merging two gaps. |
| c<sub>d</sub> | r<sub>ins</sub> | Threshold on acceptable range difference between most distance gap edge points for merging two gaps. Recommended to lie in the range  [0.5,2] r<sub>ins</sub>. |
| &epsilon; = (&epsilon;<sup>1</sup>,&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>) | (r<sub>ins</sub>,r<sub>ins</sub>) | Defines a vector with a base at the gap point and rotated relative to the gap curve tangent that would not be visible by the robot because it is on the other side of a radial gap. Rotating the radial gap and the point at the end of the vector about the gap edge point by the angle of this vector &#951; = atan(&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>/&epsilon;<sup>1</sup>), makes the point line of sight visible. In doing so, the robot now has visibility on the other side of the transformed gap, which aids in the determination of a safe local goal point on the other side of the gap and the construction of a safe local trajectory. Usually scales with r<sub>ins</sub>.|

### Gradient Field Construction
| Parameter |        Value      | Meaning |
| --------- | :---------------: | ------- |
| &tau;<sub>GA</sub> | &pi;/2 or &pi; | Maximum allowable angle between two gap endpoints (or their absolute angular difference in polar space). Which to use depends on whether radial extension is enabled. Larger when enabled, smaller when not. Ensures that the final polar triangle defined by the robot and the gap is convex. Convexity guarantees line-of-sight visibility of the local goal from any point within the gap region defined by the polar triangle. In effect, this connecting line along the line-of-sight is guaranteed to be collision free. |
| &delta; | 1 | Decay factor in equation 3 for constructing purely rotational vector field. |

### Trajectory Scoring
These parameters are similar to the trajectory scoring parameters used in the ROS _move\_base_ package.

| Parameter |        Value      | Meaning |
| --------- | :---------------: | ------- |
| w<sub>1</sub> | n/2 | Amplification factor so that the score associated to the terminal state is comparable in scaling to the score generated by integrating along the trajectory (or summing along discrete points along the trajectory). Here n is the number of discrete points evaluated along the trajectory. |
| w<sub>2</sub> | 3 | Decay factor on penalty for getting close to an obstacle point. |
| c<sub>obs</sub> | -1 | Amplification factor and sign correction for the obstacle proximity penalty. |
| r<sub>max</sub> | 0.3 | Maximum distance to decide if the cost is zero. If the distance to obstacle is large enough, there is no need to include in the cost computing. This value should be larger than r<sub>ins</sub>. |

### Control and Projection Operator

| Parameter |        Value      | Meaning |
| --------- | :---------------: | ------- |
| &lambda;<sub>y</sub> | 1 | Conversion gain for mapping lateral controls to turn rates for standard nonholonomic vehicles (forward speed and turn rate control inputs) |
| r<sub>min</sub> | 2 r<sub>ins</sub> | Potential field minimal radius, at which distance the level-set value is 1. Should be related to the inscribed radius. |
| r<sub>nom</sub> | 1 | Potential field nominal radius, at which distance the level-set value is 0. Determines when correction response starts to reshape the command vector to preserve forward invariance. Should be some multiple of the circumscribed radius of the robot. The difference between r<sub>min</sub> and r<sub>nom</sub> defines a band in space where command reshaping happens. A smaller difference gives a smaller region and more sensitive reshaping.  A larger difference gives a larger region and less aggressive reshaping. The value given is the one used for the Turtlebot. |
